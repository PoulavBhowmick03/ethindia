# Empoweria
## What is it?
The problem Empoweria solves
In the fabric of our communities, a pervasive silence has taken root, stifling the voices of those yearning to speak out due to the paralyzing fear of judgment and reprisal. In response to this, we embark on a transformative mission, introducing a groundbreaking platform designed to empower the common individual to articulate their societal challenges and grievances anonymously. Utilizing anon aadhar, our platform ensures Indian identity verification while preserving the sanctity of user anonymity through a sophisticated Circom extractor, instilling a sense of trust within the community. Beyond mere text, we integrate video calling and chat options powered by interest matching, fostering dynamic conversations among community members. With the secure and decentralized Waku protocol, we create a confidential space where individuals can engage freely, unburdened by societal constraints. This initiative aims to dismantle the barriers of fear, nurturing a more inclusive society where every voice, particularly the common Joe's, resonates and contributes to a collective narrative that embraces diversity and addresses shared challenges. Together, we forge a path towards a society where the strength of community lies not just in unity but in the freedom to express, ensuring that every individual is not merely heard but genuinely listened to, fostering understanding and empathy in the tapestry of our shared human experience.

Challenges we ran into
Getting internet connectivity was very difficult so the pace of project slowed down a lot. We built a circom extractor to extract certain regex in our pdf , but we could not build the mechanism to check if the pdf document was tampered or not. We were facing web sockets issue in Waku and huddle, we had to deal with interest matching so that we pair people on based on their interests.
